Simple compiler and webapp for *Modelleertaal*
==========================================

[![travis](https://travis-ci.com/tomkooij/modelleertaal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tomkooij/modelleertaal)

*Modelleertaal* to javascript compiler in javascript/jison. A simple demo webapp is included that can run most (all?)
of the models used in high school physics in NL.

## Webapp

[![Webapp screenshot](/screenshot.png)](https://tomkooij.github.io/modelleertaal)

[Try the webapp!](https://tomkooij.github.io/modelleertaal)

The webapp (HTML/Javascript) should run on Windows/MacOS/Android/iOS in any browser. It was designed for and tested on Chrome.
The webapp is very limited, but it should be easy to use *and* it should run all models used in Dutch High School Physics classes.
If it doesn't work or isn't easy to use: Please provide feedback.

## Using the webapp in your own website

(please do!)

Only `index.html` and the folders `scripts/` and `modellen/` are needed to run the webapp in a browser or in a website. However
you need the browserified file `scripts/modelleertaal-app.browser.js`which is not included in the `master` branch.
You can build it yourself (see below) or download a zip or tarball from the [release page](https://github.com/tomkooij/modelleertaal/releases).

Optionally change the models in `modellen/` and edit `modellen/models.js` accordingly. Put it on a website somewhere. 
All code runs in the browser, so a server is not needed.

The webapp can be easily customized (button/options turned off and on) but documentation is lacking. See `index.html`.

## About *Modelleertaal*

*Modelleertaal* is the language used for "natuurkundig modelleren"
(dynamical models in high school physics in NL. System dynamics, Jay W. Forrester, DYNAMO, ...)
The language is a subset of "CoachTaal" which is an imperative language derived from Pascal.

*Modelleertaal* tries to resemble the syntax used in NL textbooks and exams, which is CoachTaal with some differences:

 - Statements are not ; terminated
 - = is used for assignments (:= is allowed, and treated as an alias. Slightly different from CoachTaal)
 - == is used for the 'equal' operator, instead of =. In practice the == operator should never be used.
 - Only 'als dan eindals' 'anders' and 'stop' statements are implemented. Other flowcontrol is never used in *Modelleertaal*.
 - Functions cannot be defined. Most math functions from CoachTaal are implemented.
 - sin(x), cos(x) and tan(x) are always in degrees. Other trig functions in radians.
 - C/Java style comments are allowed

Example:
```
Als (a == 0) En Niet(b == Waar) Dan Stop       'modelleertaal
```

In Pascal:
```
If (a = 0) AND !(b = True) then Halt(0);
```

Examen vwo 2005-I Champignon:
```
     'model parachutesprong
     'modelregels
     Fwr = k * v^2
     Fres = Fzw - Fwr
     a = Fres/m
     dv = a * dt
     v = v + dv
     dy = v * dt
     y = y + dy
     h = h0 - y
     t = t + dt
     als h < 400 dan k = 0.6 * (400 - h) eindals
     als h < 350 dan k = 30 eindals
```

## About the modelleertaal compiler

`evaluator.js` contains a compiler for *Modelleertaal* to javascript. Using a modern javascript compiler such as Node.js/Chrome V8 it is very fast. `run.js` contains a benchmark. Compared to other modellertaal interpreters/compilers it is orders of magnitude faster.

The parser is build using [jison](https://github.com/zaach/jison). Modelleertaal is compiled to javascript which is executed using `eval()`. The `eval()` has been wrapped into an anonymous function to prevent bailout of the V8 optimising compiler.

Usage:
```javascript
model = new evaluator_js.Model();
model.modelregels = "a = a + 1";
model.startwaarden ="a = 1\n b=2\n";

N = 1000;
var evaluator = new evaluator_js.ModelregelsEvaluator(model);
results = evaluator.run(N);
```

`model.js` is used to read/write models. Models are stored in `BogusXML` which has an XML-like syntax with `<` and `>` allowed.

## Installation for development

To use the `master` branch (development version) of the webapp and/or compiler you will need to build it. This requires Node.js,
npm and grunt:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt
```

## Running the webapp offline

The webapp should run offline, but browser security may interfere with loading the models. (Cross site scripting protection may
block the ajax request). At the time of writing CORS protection blocks the webapp on Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Either install a
browser extension that disables CORS protection or use a local webserver (`python -m http.server`)

## License and credits

This compiler and webapp implements the language used in Dutch High School Physics exams.
This language is (based on) Coach and CoachTaal. Coach is developped by [CMA Science](http://cma-science.nl/).

The webapp was built using jQuery and Flot and heavily inspired by [HiSPARC jSPARC](http://github.com/HiSPARC/jSPARC/).

This was originally based on Zach Carter's [jsconf 2010 jison talk](https://github.com/zaach/zii-jsconf2010-talk).
