*Modelleertaal* to javascript compiler in javascript/jison. A simple demo webapp is included that can run most (all?)
of the models used in high school physics in NL.

## Webapp

[![Webapp screenshot](/screenshot.png)](https://tomkooij.github.io)

[Try the webapp!](https://tomkooij.github.io)

The webapp (HTML/Javascript) should run on Windows/MacOS/Android/iOS in any browser. It was designed for and tested on Chrome. The webap is very limited, but it should be easy to use *and* it should run all models used in Dutch High School Physics classes. If it doesn't work or isn't easy to use: Please provide feedback.

## About Modelleertaal

*Modelleertaal* is the language used for "natuurkundig modelleren"
(dynamical models in high school physics in NL. System dynamics, Jay W. Forrester, DYNAMO, ...)
The language is a subset of "CoachTaal" which is an imperative language derived from Pascal.

*Modelleertaal* tries to resemble the syntax used in NL textbooks and exams, which is CoachTaal with some differences:

 - Statements are not ; terminated
 - = is used for assignments (:= is allowed, and treated as an alias. Slightly different from CoachTaal)
 - == is used for the 'equal' operator, instead of =. In practice the == operator should never be used.
 - Only 'als dan eindals' and 'stop' statements are implemented. Other flowcontrol is never used in *Modelleertaal*.
 - Functions cannot be defined. Most math functions from CoachTaal are implemented.
 - sin(x), cos(x) and tan(x) are always in radians.
 - C/Java style comments are allowed

Example:
```
Als (a == 0) En Niet(b == Waar) Dan Stop       'modelleertaal
```

In Pascal:
```
If (a = 0) AND !(b = True) then Halt(0);
```

Examen vwo 2005-I Champignon:
```
     'model parachutesprong
     'modelregels
     Fwr = k * v^2
     Fres = Fzw - Fwr
     a = Fres/m
     dv = a * dt
     v = v + dv
     dy = v * dt
     y = y + dy
     h = h0 - y
     t = t + dt
     als h < 400 dan k = 0.6 * (400 - h) eindals
     als h < 350 dan k = 30 eindals
```

## About the modelleertaal compiler

`evaluator.js` contains a compiler for *Modelleertaal* to javascript. Using a modern javascript compiler such as Node.js/Chrome V8 it is very fast. `run.js` contains a benchmark. Compared to other modellertaal interpreters/compilers it is orders of magnitude faster.

The parser is build using [jison](https://github.com/zaach/jison). Modellertaal is compiled to javascript which is executed using `eval()`. The `eval()` has been wrapped into an anonymous function to prevent bailout of the V8 optimising compiler.

Usage:
```javascript
model = new evaluator_js.Model();
model.modelregels = "a = a + 1";
model.startwaarden ="a = 1\n b=2\n";

N = 1000;
var evaluator = new evaluator_js.ModelregelsEvaluator(model);
results = evaluator.run(N);
```

`model.js` is used to read/write models. Models are stored in `BogusXML` which has an XML-like syntax with `<` and `>` allowed.

## Installation

Node.js using npm and grunt:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt
```

## Usage

A Node.js example in in `run.js`:
```
node run
```
